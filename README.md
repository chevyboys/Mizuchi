## Project Mizuchi - Custom Discord bot for the Climbers Court Community

Mizuchi is built in Node.js for the Climbers Court community. It runs on the [Augur framework](https://github.com/Gaiwecoor/augurbot), utilizing the [Discord.js library](https://discord.js.org/). The name Mizuchi is based on a character from the works of [Andrew Rowe](https://andrewkrowe.wordpress.com/). The code is owned by the climbers court community staff members.

Pull requests from the community are welcome. Speak with Behold on Discord prior to starting to ensure your features fit with the bot.

When submitting a PR, please include the following questions with the appropriate answers:
* Are any changes to config.json necessary? If so, are they reflected in config-example.json?
* Are all referenced snowflakes contained in the config/snowflake.json file, rather than in the code directly?
* Are any changes to Interaction fingerprints needed? If so, are they reflected in the appropriate file in /registry?
* Have I used JSdoc style comments (at least) to properly document all of my functions? 
* Are there any new dependencies that need to be installed? If so, are they reflected in package.json?


Some code has been re-used with permission from Kevin Dixon (Gaiwecoor).
